| [Pipfile](https://github.com/TiagoIesbick/api-little-lemon/blob/master/Pipfile)           | The code in the Pipfile file specifies the dependencies and required versions of the packages for a project. In this case, it lists Django, Django Rest Framework, Djoser, Django Rest Framework XML, Django Filter, and Bleach as the required packages. The code also specifies that these packages should be fetched from the PyPI package repository and that they should be compatible with Python version 3.11. |
| [notes.txt](https://github.com/TiagoIesbick/api-little-lemon/blob/master/notes.txt)       | The code contains user credentials for a superuser, manager, delivery crew, and customers. Each user has a username, email, and password associated with their account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [Pipfile.lock](https://github.com/TiagoIesbick/api-little-lemon/blob/master/Pipfile.lock) | Pipfile.lock replaces the requirements.txt file used in most Python projects and adds security benefits of tracking the packages hashes that were last locked. This file is managed automatically through locking actions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
